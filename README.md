Before starting this new section learned how to close old directory and open new VSC window with new directory.
Already knew how to create new repository and clone it to my local machine, did it without problem.
Practicing how to commit whenever it is neccesary.

In this new repo, i'm going to apply what we already learned about HTML from previous sections and from what i learned from freeCodecamp.
